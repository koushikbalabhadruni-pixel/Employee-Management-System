💼 Employee Management System (SQL Project)

📘 Overview
The Employee Management System is a relational SQL project designed to efficiently manage and organize employee data within an organization. It centralizes employee records such as personal details, job roles, departments, and payroll information, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.


🎯 Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
	•	⚙️ Automate storage, updates, and retrieval of employee information
	•	🧾 Reduce manual errors and ensure reliable data management
	•	📈 Enable HR data analysis through SQL queries
	•	💡 Support informed decision-making for payroll and workforce planning

🧩 ER Diagram Overview
This system includes six key tables (entities):

	•	👨‍💼 `Employee` – Holds employee details
  
	•	🏢 `JobDepartment` – Contains job roles and department data
  
	•	💰 `SalaryBonus` – Maintains salary and bonus information
  
	•	🧾 `Payroll` – Tracks payment histories
  
	•	🎓 `Qualification` – Stores academic and professional records
  
	•	🕒 `Leave` – Manages employee leaves and attendance


Relationships are maintained through primary and foreign keys for data integrity


🗂️ Schema Design
	•	`Employee` ➡️ `JobDepartment` (via `JobID`)
  
	•	`SalaryBonus` ➡️ `JobDepartment` (salary structure)
  
	•	`Payroll` ➡️ integrates Employee, Job, and Leave info
  
	•	`Qualification` & `Leave` ➡️ linked by `EmpID`
